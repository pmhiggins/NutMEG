Citing NutMEG
=============

If you have used NutMEG in a project and are looking for a way to reference it, please cite the following paper:

Higgins P.M. and Cockell C.S. (2020) 'A bioenergetic model to predict habitability, biomass and biosignatures in extreme conditions and astrobiology' J. R. Soc. Interface 17 (171) pp. 20200588 DOI: `10.1098/rsif.2020.0588 <https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0588>`_

If you know the specific version you used, you can also refer to it as archived on Zenodo:

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/239535694.svg
   :target: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/239535694

The button above points to the latest version, but from there you can naviagate to find a DOI for whichever one you used.

Thanks!
