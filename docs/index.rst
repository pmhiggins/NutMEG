Nutrients, Maintenance, Energy and Growth
===========================================
Welcome to NutMEG's documentation! NutMEG is a python module for predicting the
growth behaviour of microbial organisms in astrobiology. It's designed to
estimate the energetic availability through local chemistry and the cost of
defending against extreme or adverse conditions to work out whether an
environment could be habitable.
