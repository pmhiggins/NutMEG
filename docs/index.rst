*Nutrients, Maintenance, Energy and Growth*

Welcome to NutMEG's documentation! `NutMEG <https://github.com/pmhiggins/NutMEG>`_ is a python module for predicting the
growth behaviour of microbial organisms in astrobiology. It's designed to
estimate the energetic availability through local chemistry and the cost of
defending against extreme or adverse conditions to work out whether an
environment could be habitable and how biology could behave there.

NutMEG is still a work-in-progress, but as of its most recent release it can be
used to create tentative growth predictions of known organisms in known environments.
Check out the `competition example <guides/competitionexample.html>`_ for an idea of
what it can do at this stage.
