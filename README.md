# NutMEG
### Nutrients, Maintenance, Energy &amp; Growth.  A model for predicting energetic habitability.

To use NutMEG, download this repo --- or for peace of mind the most recent release --- and use the NutMEG folder as if a local python package e.g. `import NutMEG`. A complete setup guide is available in NutMEG's [documentation](https://nutmeg-astrobiology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/getting_started.html). Then, thorough examples for using NutMEG can be found in the [NutMEG-Implementations respository](http://github.com/pmhiggins/NutMEG-Implementations)

If you want to get a taste of what NutMEG can do, check out the [documentation](https://nutmeg-astrobiology.readthedocs.io)!

Tested and working on Python 3.7.x. Dependencies: numpy, pandas, reaktoro. Due to the reaktoro dependence, we strongly advise to use NutMEG from within a conda envrionment to enhance ease of use. Advice on getting this working is [here](https://nutmeg-astrobiology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/getting_started.html).
