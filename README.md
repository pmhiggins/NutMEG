# NutMEG
### Nutrients, Maintenance, Energy &amp; Growth.  A model for predicting energetic habitability.

To use, download the repo and use the NutMEG folder as if a python package e.g. `import NutMEG`. Thorough examples for using this can be found in the [NutMEG-Implementations respository](http://github.com/pmhiggins/NutMEG-Implementations)

If you want to explore what NutMEG can do, check out the [documentation](https://nutmeg-astrobiology.readthedocs.io)!

Tested and working on Python 3.7.x. Dependencies: numpy, pandas, reaktoro. Due to the reaktoro dependence, we strongly advise to use NutMEG from within a conda envrionment to enhance ease of use.
